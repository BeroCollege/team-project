 How It Works:
Each category has its own list of goals, each with a progress bar.
Clicking a goal opens its detailed page, where users can complete tasks.
Clicking on tasks marks them as completed (green) or not completed (red).
Progress bars automatically update based on completed tasks.
Back button returns to the correct category page instead of always going to the home page.
All progress is saved, so updates remain even after refreshing the page.

 How to Add More Goals
The database is in JavaScript as an object inside script.js.
To add a new goal, edit the goalCategories object in fetchGoals().
When added, the goal automatically appears on the correct main page and links to its detail page.
The teacher's system will eventually handle adding goals dynamically.


Goals to add for them:
Football team
Art class
Reading and writing
Swimming club

Co-desingers doing their part first:
-Presenting their UIzard part
Amy is doing intro
Karl is talking about why goals are important
Dean is talking about why goals are important too
Johnathon is talking about actions

Then we will be talking about how we made it into code and developed it and also talk through our app and provide demonstration

TO-DO:
- Move goals to copleted as soon as they are completed instead of keeping them in the goals im doing page.
