# iPlanit Goals Section (Next.js)

This project displays a goals section within the iPlanit application, built with Next.js and React.

## Getting Started

### Note:
If you want to run the dev server to have a look you need to have Node.js installed
and npm installed.

After than you will probably have to run
```bash
npm install next
```

to be able to run the dev server.

### Running the Development Server

To run the project locally in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The important files to worry about relating to the page layout for goals are:
- app/components/Goals.js
- app/components/Goals.module.css
- app/global.css
- app/page.js (Shouldnt have to do anything here really)
- app/page.module.css

- public/goals-images/ contains the images for the goals
